# LEGACY CODEBASE
## Kotlin Camera Codebase
This repository contains the original codebase for CritterSleuth's android app.  
This codebase is written in Kotlin and is currently abandoned.

This codebase is not currently being maintained, but is being kept for historical purposes.

This was abandoned because of the difficulty of using Retrofit and Kotlin together.
